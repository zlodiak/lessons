<p>Well it was easy enough to fix... In the user.rb file you were missing these lines:</p><p>index do<br>    column :email<br>    column :current_sign_in_at<br>    column :last_sign_in_at<br>    column :sign_in_count<br>    default_actions<br>  end<br>Once I added those (which I copied from the admin_user.rb which I graciously backed-up...) it worked like a charm! So I guess I'll give you a B+ for this one. (Until you update the article of course...)</p>

<p>I followed all the directions and I was able to login... but for some odd reason there is no option for creating a new user. I can only seclect the default user, click batch, and delete it (which, for obvious reasons, I have not done.) Anyway other than that it seems to work. I login, it returns me to the homepage, then if I use the "/admin" it takes me into ActiveAdmin (only with no options for creating users once you click on Users.)</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for this tutorial. I just did it more or less from scratch, and the one deviation that I had some trouble with was the original devise_create_admin_users migration, which referenced the AdminUser class.</p><p>I don't know if I missed a db:migrate command earlier in the process that would have run this migration before I removed the AdminUser class, but trying to do it as one mondo migration at the end after the class was knocked out didn't work (as you would expect).</p><p>Otherwise, all good! Thanks!</p>

<p>This was written over a year ago (see the "Environment" section for more info) so I might have to give this walk-through another run-through to check for any hiccups with newer versions of ActiveAdmin or Rails.</p><p>Maybe I'll create a GitHub base project hosting a couple of <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer" rel="nofollow">Rails Composer</a> templates and some tests when I get some free time.</p><p>Thanks for the feedback and kind words; This post was a labor of love :)</p>

<p>Speaking to your issues; This post was written over a year ago, and states specific versions used to create the solution.</p><p>Off the top of my head I'm not quite sure what your issue might be. Possibly a misconfigurated ActiveAdmin file, or trying to set the `user.password_digest` attribute directly (Devise will do this for you by just setting `user.password = "xxxx") -- but again I just don't know w/o seeing the code.</p><p>I'll try and grab some time to write an "updated" version of this post to reflect any changes with newer versions of ActiveAdmin and/or Rails that may have broken this process.</p><p>However, as far as I know these steps still works as written.</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>GREAT write-up!  Thanks so much for taking the time!!</p><p>One note: If using PostGres, there is a known bug in the active-admin "AdminNotes" migration.  The Resource ID needs to be defined as integer rather than string.</p><p>So, in xxxx_create_admin_notes.rb change line 4 to be:<br>t.integer :resource_id, :null =&gt; false</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks for writing this up.</p><p>I wanted to point out that there is a security issue in your sample: by adding `superadmin` to attr_accessible, you're allowing users to give themselves that privilege. They can do so, for example, by modifying the request parameters sent from Devise's registration controller (where users can change their password).</p>
