The simplest way is to use "idAttribute" option of Backbone Model to let Backbone know the that you want to use "name" as your Model Id.

 Friend = Backbone.Model.extend({
      //Create a model to hold friend attribute
      name: null,
      idAttribute: 'name'
 });
Now you can directly use Collection.get() method to retrieve a friend using his name. This way Backbone does not loop through all of your Friend models in the Collection but can directly fetch a model based on its "name".

var lee = friends.get('Lee');
